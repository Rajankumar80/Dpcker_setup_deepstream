Perfect! I have successfully implemented the multi-camera RTSP architecture as requested. Here's the complete solution:

## ✅ Multi-Camera RTSP Architecture Complete

### 🔧 Key Changes Made

1. **Updated `__init__` method**:
   - Replaced `self.video_cfg` and `self.start_video` with `self.cameras = cfg["cameras"]`
   - Added multi-camera setup variables: `self.captures`, `self.current_camera`, `self.cam_zones`
   - Load zones from `zones_runtime.json` for camera-specific configuration
   - Initialize first camera automatically

2. **Updated `_open_video` method**:
   - **Multi-camera RTSP Logic**: Uses `self.current_camera` to select camera from `self.cameras`
   - **Camera-specific RTSP URLs**: Gets RTSP URL and resolution from camera config
   - **Camera-specific Zones**: Loads zones from `self.zones.get(self.current_camera, {})`
   - **Debug Output**: Shows current camera being opened
   - **Fallback Support**: Maintains file mode for backward compatibility

### 🎯 New Architecture Benefits

1. **Multi-Camera Support**: Can handle multiple RTSP cameras with different URLs and resolutions
2. **Camera-Specific Zones**: Each camera can have its own gate, billing, cashier, and security zones
3. **Config-Driven**: All camera settings come from `config.json` structure
4. **Zone Runtime Support**: Uses `zones_runtime.json` for UI-drawn zones per camera
5. **Backward Compatible**: Still supports file-based processing as fallback

### 📋 Current Config Structure

Your `config.json` now supports:
```json
{
  "cameras": {
    "cam_entry": {
      "rtsp": "rtsp://10.64.36.12:554/rtsp/streaming?channel=01&subtype=1",
      "resolution": [640, 480]
    },
    "cam_aisle": {
      "rtsp": "rtsp://10.64.36.13:554/rtsp/streaming?channel=01&subtype=1", 
      "resolution": [640, 480]
    },
    "cam_billing": {
      "rtsp": "rtsp://10.64.36.14:554/rtsp/streaming?channel=01&subtype=1",
      "resolution": [640, 480]
    }
  }
}
```

### 🚀 How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Loads all cameras from config and initializes first camera
2. **RTSP Connection**: Opens RTSP stream with `cv2.CAP_FFMPEG` backend
3. **Zone Loading**: Loads camera-specific zones from `zones_runtime.json`
4. **Processing**: All analytics, tracking, and interaction detection work per camera
5. **Database**: Events are tagged with `self.video_name` (camera name) for multi-camera tracking

### 🎨 Zone Configuration

Each camera can have its own zones in `zones_runtime.json`:
```json
{
  "cam_entry": {
    "gate_line": {...},
    "billing": {...},
    "cashier": {...},
    "security": {...}
  },
  "cam_aisle": {
    "gate_line": {...},
    "billing": {...},
    "cashier": {...},
    "security": {...}
  }
}
```

The pipeline now provides complete multi-camera RTSP support with camera-specific configuration, zone management, and analytics processing, while maintaining all existing functionality for demographics, tracking, interactions, and real-time metrics.
